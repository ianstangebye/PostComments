# PostComments

Simply used the same technique that we did with posts and applied it to comments. I then took the response from the comments IIFE and ran a filter function on it to match with the postId (from the url) and appended those to the correct div. I did basic styling to show more delineation from one comment/post to the next by having each odd div have a different background color.
